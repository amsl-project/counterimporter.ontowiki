# OntoWiki counter data import

This OntoWiki extension was developed for and during [amsl project](http://amsl.technology) at [Leipzig University Library](http://ub.uni-leipzig.de/).

This extension adds an option to import [counter](http://www.niso.org/schemas/sushi/#counter) data via [sushi](http://www.niso.org/schemas/sushi/) protocol or file upload (counter xml). 
The resulting triples (rdf) are described in [counter vocabulary](http://vocab.ub.uni-leipzig.de/counter).
